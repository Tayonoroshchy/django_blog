When he was in the forest, he decided to rest a little, as the day was very hot and he was very tired.\r\n\r\n  The man saw a large tree. He decided to rest under it.\r\n\r\n  As the sun was very hot, the man put on one of the caps on his head and put all the other caps on the ground under the tree. The man had lunch, then lay down and soon was asleep. When he woke up, he could not find the caps.\r\n\r\n“Where are my caps?” he cried. He could not find them anywhere.  \r\n\r\n    Suddenly he looked up. And what did he see? He saw many monkeys in the tree, and each monkey had the man’s cap on its head!\r\n\r\n“Give me back my caps!” cried the man. But the monkeys could not understand the man. They laughed, jumped and played with the caps.\r\n\r\nThe man asked and asked the monkeys to give him back his caps, but the monkeys didn’t understand him. They only laughed.\r\n\r\nThe man got very much angry with the monkeys. He took off his cap, threw it on the ground and cried: “If you want my caps, you may take this one, too!”\r\n\r\nAnd do you know what the monkeys did? They took off the caps and threw them on the ground!\r\n\r\nThat’s how the man got back all his caps.\r\n\r\nCertainly, he was very glad. He quickly took all his caps and went away.",

    "body": "One day a boy found a brown bear-cub in the forest. He was very little and looked like a puppy. The boy carried him home.\r\n\r\nEvery day the boy went to school. The bear-cub went with him and waited for the boy in the field.\r\n\r\nAt first the other boys were afraid of the bear-cub, but soon they became great friends. Many of them brought food to school and gave the bear-cub some bread and butter.\r\n\r\nThe bear-cub lived with the boy for a long time. But one day he went to the forest and did not come back. Everybody was very sorry for the bear-cub.\r\n\r\nMany years passed. New schoolboys came to the old school. One very cold winter day the door opened, and a large brown bear walked into the classroom.  The boys were afraid. Some ran to the door, others jumped out of the window.\r\n\r\nBut the bear did not touch the pupils. He walked up to the fire and warmed himself. He felt quite at home. He was very glad to get into such a warm room. He sat by the fire, and then walked up to the table and ate some bread. Then the bear walked out of the house.\r\n\r\nSome young men of the village came with their guns to kill the bear. They soon found him but did not kill him. They saw some marks on his skin and understood that the bear was the old friend of their schooldays. They let him go back into the forest.",
